# Deep Generative Models - Course Assignments

## University of Tehran, Fall 2023

This repository contains my homework submissions for the "Deep Generative Models" course offered at the University of Tehran in Fall 2023. The course was instructed by Dr. Tavassolipour and Dr. Sadeghi. The assignments cover a range of topics in deep generative modeling, including probabilistic graphical models, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and more.
